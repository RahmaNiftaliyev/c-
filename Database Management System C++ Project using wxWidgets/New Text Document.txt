About Database Management System:
Database management system is basically a software or application that allows user to perform database operations on a computer. These operations include adding, editing, retrieving and deleting data. Database management system is more commonly known as DBMS.

So, in database management system project, there would be a file manager that would manage data in databases instead of managing files in file systems. The RDBMS – relational database management system utilizes relational model of tables and relationships to carry out the database function.

About wxWidgets:
wxWidgets is a totally object oriented C++ library for GUI programming, i.e. creating GUIs (graphical user interfaces) for cross-platform applications. It lets users create apps for Windows, Linux, Mas OS X and some other platforms working on a single code base. With wxWidgets, a program’s GUI code can be compiled and run on cross platforms with no or minimal code modifications.

Not only this database management system project in C++, many applications we are familiar with are made in wxWidgets; Code::Blocks is the most common example. It gives applications a truly native feel and outlook as it rather than emulating the Graphical User Interface (GUI), utilizes the computer platform’s own API. Furthermore, wxWidgets is free, extensive, mature and open-source.

Analyzing and understanding wxWidgets-based applications can be a real headache for beginners. For example: writing a simple program to print “Programming is Fun”, needs a lot of knowledge and somewhat complex code conversion. But once you get used to it, everything gets simpler, and you can easily develop big applications within a few weeks.
