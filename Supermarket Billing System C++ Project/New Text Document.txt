Supermarket Billing System C++ Project



This supermarket billing system is a simple console application built in C++ without the use of graphics. This project will help you understand basically two things – use of stream class and file handling in c++ programming language.

Two classes, class amount and class item can be found in this project in which class amount is inherited from the class item. The project is simple to understand, and the source code has been presented in an understandable manner.

The source code for this project is long, over 700 lines, so I haven’t included it here. The code is complete and totally error-free, but there are rooms for improvement.

The C++ source code of this supermarket billing system project needs to be compiled in Code::Blocks using GCC compiler. You can directly download the source code plus the executable file from the link below.
