Telephone Directory System C++ Project

Features:

The features of telephone directory system are mainly related to adding, listing, searching, modifying and deleting telephone directory-related records. All these operations are done through file handling, i.e., all the added and modified data are recorded in file, and the deleted information are removed from the program file.

The information contained in the telephone directory records are the name, phone number and address of the person whose record is entered in the telephone directory system project in C++. So, the simple file handling cum telephone directory operations users can perform in this project are:

•    Add telephone record
•    Show records
•    Modify record
•    Search telephone records
•    Delete record
